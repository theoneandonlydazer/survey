# survey
#This is a basic web survey that gathers data and suggests coding languges to learn
#The only set up is to go to the web address and pick answers to obtain suggestions.
#There are probably some bugs in this code :)
#Contact for support: Danazer@gmail.com
#I used CSS, HTML, and Jquery to make this page. I used branching to gather the answers given and provide a response
